## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest version for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/awake/releases) page.

### System Requirements

#### Linux
- Requires `xdotool` package for keyboard simulation
  ```bash
  # Manjaro/Arch:
  sudo pacman -S xdotool
  
  # Ubuntu/Debian:
  sudo apt-get install xdotool
  ```

#### Windows
- No additional requirements
- Uses Windows API for keyboard simulation

#### macOS
- No additional requirements
- Uses macOS Quartz Event Services for keyboard simulation

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Click the system tray icon to access the menu
3. Select "Disable Sleep" to prevent the system from sleeping
4. Select "Enable Sleep" to return to normal system behavior
5. Select "Quit" to exit the application

## How it Works

Awake uses a user-space approach to keep your system awake by simulating a key press every minute. This method:
- Doesn't require administrator privileges
- Is lightweight and efficient
- Works in the background
